# Initial Setup

1. Install [node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Acquire *weather.com* and *mapbox.com* API keys. These are required for weather data and radar frames respectively.
3. Go to `/webroot/js` and open `config.js`.
4. Line 1 is where your *weather.com*  API key goes. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your *weather.com* API key.
5. Line 2 is where your *mapbox.com*  API key goes. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your *mapbox.com* API key.
6. Save your changes to `config.js` and close out of it.
7. In terminal / command prompt within the webroot directory, run `npm install`. This will install all dependencies required to run.
8. In terminal / command prompt within the webroot directory, run `npm start`. This will start a local web server, which is required to run the sim.
